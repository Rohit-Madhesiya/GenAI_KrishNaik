# Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing

This repository provides hands-on implementations of essential Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using Machine Learning. It covers fundamental preprocessing steps, feature extraction methods, and advanced word embedding techniques to help build robust NLP models.
## Table of Contents

1. [Tokenization](https://github.com/Rohit-Madhesiya/ML_for_NLP/blob/main/Tokenization_Example.ipynb) – Splitting text into meaningful units like words and sentences.

2. [Text Preprocessing - Stemming, Lemmatization, and Stopwords](https://github.com/Rohit-Madhesiya/ML_for_NLP/blob/main/Text_Preprocessing_Stemming_Lemmatization_Stopwords.ipynb) – Cleaning text data by normalizing words and removing irrelevant tokens.
3. [Parts of Speech Tagging](https://github.com/Rohit-Madhesiya/ML_for_NLP/blob/main/Parts_of_Speech_Tagging.ipynb) - Identifying the grammatical category of words in a sentence.
4. [Named Entity Recognition - NER](https://github.com/Rohit-Madhesiya/ML_for_NLP/blob/main/Named_Entity_Recognition.ipynb) – Extracting key entities like names, locations, and date/time from text.
5. [Bow of Words](https://github.com/Rohit-Madhesiya/ML_for_NLP/blob/main/Bag_of_Words_BOW_Practicals.ipynb) – Representing text numerically in vector form using word frequencies.
6. [Word2Vec Implementation](https://github.com/Rohit-Madhesiya/ML_for_NLP/blob/main/Word2Vector_Practical.ipynb) – Learning word embeddings for capturing semantic relationships between words.
